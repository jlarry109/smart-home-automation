# üìù Smart Home Automation System ‚Äì Design Document

##  Summary

This project builds a modular smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi (C++), AWS IoT Core, and MQTT to control and monitor home devices like lights, fans, and sensors. The system allows remote interaction, telemetry logging, and scalable multi-device coordination while leveraging modern C++ practices and cloud services.

##  Problem Statement

Most consumer smart home solutions are closed, proprietary, or cloud-locked, limiting flexibility and local control. There is a need for an **open, edge-first smart home framework** that allows:
- Low-latency control
- Local override for safety
- Scalable integration with cloud services
- Secure communication between devices and users

##  Objective

- Use **modern C++** to control GPIO-based devices on Raspberry Pi.
- Communicate securely with AWS IoT using **MQTT**.
- Publish telemetry (e.g., temperature, motion) and subscribe to control topics.
- Handle cloud outages with graceful local fallbacks.
- Provide optional extensions (e.g., camera integration, dashboard, alerts).

##  Proposed Solution

The system consists of:
- **Edge devices** (Raspberry Pi nodes) running modern C++ apps using smart pointers and threads.
- **Cloud messaging** via AWS IoT Core with secure X.509 TLS.
- Optional **event processing** using AWS Lambda.
- Optional **telemetry storage** using DynamoDB.
- A **modular dashboard** built in React (optional) for user interaction.

##  Proposed Design

### Key Components
| Component       | Responsibility                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi    | Device control (lights, sensors) via GPIO       |
| C++ App         | MQTT publish/subscribe, local device logic      |
| AWS IoT Core    | Secure message brokering & device shadow        |
| Lambda (cloud)  | Triggered on alerts (e.g., motion detected)     |
| DynamoDB        | Store temperature, motion, and device logs      |
| Dashboard       | User interface for device monitoring            |

##  High-Level Design Diagram

_Refer to architecture diagram: `docs/architecture-diagram.png`_  
It shows interactions between:
- User ‚Üí AWS IoT ‚Üí Pi
- Pi ‚Üí AWS IoT ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB
- Local feedback loop between GPIO, sensors, and MQTT

##  Flow of Responsibility

1. **Control Flow (User ‚Üí Device):**
   - User issues command from UI
   - AWS IoT routes MQTT message to device
   - Pi toggles GPIO and publishes status update

2. **Telemetry Flow (Device ‚Üí Cloud):**
   - Pi reads temperature/motion
   - Publishes to MQTT topics (e.g., `home/room1/temp`)
   - AWS IoT Rule triggers Lambda ‚Üí logs to DynamoDB

3. **Alerting Flow:**
   - Pi detects motion ‚Üí publishes to `home/alerts/motion`
   - Lambda triggers alert to user (SMS/email)

##  Error Handling & Failures

| Failure Case                  | Handling Strategy                            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Lost Wi-Fi or Cloud Access   | Pi uses local state machine for control       |
| MQTT publish failure         | Retry with backoff, log to local buffer       |
| Sensor read fails            | Publish `null` or omit reading, log warning   |
| TLS/cert expiration          | Certificates rotated & monitored on cloud     |
| Device reboot/power loss     | Reload last known state from device shadow     |
